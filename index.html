            <h2>Real World Data Pipeline <span class="highlight">(B2B)</span></h2>
            <p>Developed an ETL pipeline at Freenome, taking it from concept to launch. The pipeline processed RWD from diverse sources and formats, standardizing it into a single Common Data Model (CDM). This unified data powered machine learning models and analyses for early cancer detection. The product served internal research teams and external partners by normalizing raw data received from them and returning it in a standardized format, while retaining the data for internal research purposes.</p>

            <h2>Analysis Pipeline <span class="highlight">(B2B)</span></h2>
            <p>Built AI-powered diagnostic software for Freenome's flagship blood test kit product, designed to assess colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Once patient samples were received, they were processed in the lab and analyzed through this AI pipeline. Machine learning models evaluated the data to determine a risk score, enabling early identification of patients at risk for CRC.</p>
